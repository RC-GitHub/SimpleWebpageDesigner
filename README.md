## Inner Workings of an App
### MainWindow:
* After the SWD App is installed, you should be greeted by the _MainWindow_.

* The _MainWindow_'s buttons allow for:
   1. **New project:** Creation of a new project. The user is asked whether they want the project to be saved in the default directory or in a specified place. After that, they are taken into the _CreationWindow_. 
      <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f81d1538-7597-4bfb-8544-dbce16be67b8" alt="MessageBox Dialog" style="width: 500px;"/> 
   
   2. **Open project:** Opening of an existing project. The user is asked about the directory of their project. Once the folder with a correct naming scheme of `SWD-[Project name]` is selected, the user is taken into the _ContentWindow_;
   
   3. **Delete existing:** Deletion of an existing project(s). The user is asked about the directory of their project. All folders with the correct naming scheme of `SWD-[Project name]` will then be deleted;
   
   4. **Theme settings:** Change of the SWD app's theme. _ThemeWindow_ is opened.

### CreationWindow:
* The _CreationWindow_ is the place where the user can set the primary settings of the SWD Project.
* Mainly: 

   1. Set the metadata of their website (Author's name, Keywords, Description) as well as the name of the Project;

   3. Add HTML Code before `<div class="grid-container">`'s contents, insert their own CSS styles and add their own JavaScript;

* After the "Submit" button is clicked, the _ContentWindow_ will be opened while the _MainWindow_ and _CreationWindow_ will close.

### ContentWindow:
* The _ContentWindow_ is the place where the user can design their own [grid layout](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp) which later on will be represented on a page.<br>

* Inside of the _ContentWindow_ the user can:
   1. Add rows and (a max of 12) columns via the Row and Column modification sections.

   2. Create their own Component. The user has to select a group of DataGrid cells and then right-click to display a context menu. After choosing one of 4 built-in Component types, the _InputDialog_ will open asking for a name of the Component. After that the user has to choose a color for their Component in order to differentiate them on the DataGrid.
